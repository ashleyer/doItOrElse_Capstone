//MYROUTES

to start i need:
- one route to all Task items
- one root route (haha)

'/'
'/task'


+ render(<Router/>, document.getElementById('app'))



routes notes:
> react router like a component
> a way to link to various urls to components (like browser changing pages)




PROBLEMS:

---Can't resolve './serviceWorker'


i dont understand:

~ re FIRST principles...
components are independent and do not rely on each other, but they must work together? is that a contradiction? confused. like if component a and b 'work together' to generate some outcome/action/result, isnt that outcome dependent on both a and b, and arent a and b depoendent on each other to make that outcome? even more, doesnt any or every component rely another one 'do'? 
im probably overthinking small things and i wont get stuck on wondering. keep going now
~ the react-router is a component, and so is each individual route? so components can exists within one another, it doesnt have to be like a compon-ette or sub-component etc..?
